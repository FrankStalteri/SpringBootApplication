This program can't be run, because the front-end and database used are part of the course that I no longer have access to.
This is just what I worked on specifically with Spring Boot to map the tables and fields to the front-end and table columns.

The Project:
A web application where users can be added to book a vacation. They pick which country to travel to, as well as their excursions.
When the user submits their order, the cartItems table gets populated, as well as the excursion_cartitems and carts tables.
I had to write the code to retrieve the JSON from the front-end (Angular), add the data to the various entities, and use their
JPA Repositories to save them to the MySQL database.
